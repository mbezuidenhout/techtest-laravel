# TechTest Laravel Application

This is a simple Laravel CRUD application featuring authentication and a people management module. The application supports local development using Docker and includes Git hooks and GitHub workflows for ensuring code consistency and test reliability.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started with Docker

You can start the application using Docker with:

```sh
docker compose --profile dev up -d
```

This will spin up all required services using the development profile.
- ✅ Home Page: https://localhost/
- 🔐 HTTPS: Self-signed SSL certificates are automatically generated by the Nginx image.
- 📬 Mail Testing: Outgoing mails can be viewed at https://localhost:8025/ via the MailHog web interface.

### ⚙️ Container Initialization Actions

When the Laravel image starts, it performs the following actions automatically:
1. Runs composer install
2. Copies the .env.example file to .env (if .env does not already exist)
   Generate the APP_KEY using php artisan key:generate
3. Execute any custom scripts found in /docker/entrypoint.d/

The directory app-entrypoint.d on the host is mounted to /docker/entrypoint.d/ inside the container.
This allows you to customize initialization behavior by placing shell scripts into the mounted folder.

#### 📂 Included Custom Scripts

Currently, the following scripts are included:
- laravelinit.sh: Runs database migrations using php artisan migrate
- npminit.sh: Installs and builds CSS and JavaScript assets using npm install && npm run build

## 👥 User Access

Any user can register and begin using the application immediately. No activation is required.

## 🔧 Git Hooks

To install the local Git hooks, run:

```sh
hooks/install-hooks.sh
```

These hooks ensure:
- ✅ Code style and formatting are checked using Laravel Pint.
- ✅ Unit and feature tests are run before allowing commits or pushes.

## ⚙️ GitHub Workflows

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows that:
- Automatically run tests on each push or pull request.
- Ensure consistency between local and server environments.

🗒️ TODO
- Enforce password strength restriction.
- Add CAPTCHA check for user registration.
- Implement front-end testing using Laravel Dusk.

## 📁 Directory Structure Notes
- The Laravel application lives inside the /app directory.
- GitHub Actions and all hooks are configured to work from this base path.
